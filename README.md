These are my files that i used to run JtR in parallel on a Parallella Beowulf 
cluster. I demo'd this cluster as part of the Special Session:
"Budget Beowulfs: A Show-case of inexpensive clusters for teaching PDC". If 
you use these files, please cite the following publication:

Adams J, Caswell J, Matthews SJ, Peck C, Shoop E, and Toth D. "Budget Beowulfs: 
A Show-case of Inexpensive Clusters for Teaching PDC". In Proceedings of the 
46th ACM technical symposium on Computer science education (SIGCSEâ€™15). Kansas 
City, MO. March 6-8, 2015.
